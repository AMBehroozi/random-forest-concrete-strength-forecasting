# Cement Strength Prediction and Feature Importance

This project predicts the **28-day compressive strength (fu)** of cement mixtures using machine learning models and analyzes feature importance. The models used include:

- **Linear Regression**
- **Random Forest**
- **Gradient Boosting**
- **XGBoost**
